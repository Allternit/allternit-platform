# Allternit Video Editor interface

The egui frontend draws panels and dialogs, and dispatches project changes through the engine.
Interactive controls keep stable automation ids regardless of the interface language.

## Localisation

Edit > Language offers English, Japanese and Spanish. The language is stored in the engine's
`general.interfaceLanguage` preference, restored on startup, and also available in Settings > General.
Its default, System Language (`system`), follows the operating system: the first of the user's
preferred languages that the interface has (the host supplies them through
`HostHooks::system_languages`: `sys-locale` on the desktop, `navigator.languages` on the web),
otherwise English.
The `app.language.*` UI commands and `prefs.set` reach it through the control channel.
Japanese requires a craft-fonts build or a suitable installed font.

English source strings are lookup keys in `src/i18n/<code>.tsv`. `tl!` translates literals, `tlf!`
fills translated templates, and `i18n::t` translates names from registries. Placeholder values
(including user filenames containing braces) are inserted literally. Catalog translations are
original work using ordinary language, without proprietary localisation resources.

Spanish covers menus, panels, dialogs, settings and registry labels. Searches accept both the
translated label and its English source, including Unicode capitals. Project content, command ids
and preference values retain their original values. Engine errors, CLI and MCP messages remain
English; Japanese currently covers core menus and falls back to English elsewhere.

Verification: `cargo test -p filmcraft-ui-egui` checks catalog syntax, duplicate keys, placeholders,
literal/menu/registry coverage and UI behaviour; `cargo xtask ci` runs the workspace gates. Visual
checks use the control channel to switch language and capture the resulting panels.

## Source playback

`source_playback.rs` auditions media independently of Program playback. It reuses MediaSource
decoding, output mapping, the device clock and the desktop play-ahead buffer. Only one monitor
owns the device at a time. Source frame jobs use the existing frame server and Source resolution.
The live project, undo stack and timeline playhead are unchanged. See [monitor documentation](../../docs/monitors.md)
for behavior, commands, limitations and regression tests. Source playback tests use synthetic
demo media and fake audio outputs; no third-party assets are introduced.

Source drag controls snapshot the selected span and dispatch `timeline.place` for video, audio,
or linked video/audio. Full-clip marks are implicit until set by the user. The engine owns edits,
range validation and undo; the UI owns the drag gesture. See `source_drag_ui` and the engine's
`source_placement_tests` for regression coverage.

Source range handles use transient gesture previews and the engine's integer-frame
`source_monitor::adjust_range`; release dispatches one mark edit. Monitor command routing
keeps Source navigation, markers and marked-range playback separate from Program.
